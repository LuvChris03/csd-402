# Water Heating Energy Calculator

## Overview
A Java command-line program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature using the specific heat formula.

## Formula
```
Q = waterMass × (finalTemperature - initialTemperature) × 4184
```

Where:
- **waterMass**: Weight of water in kilograms (kg)
- **initialTemperature**: Starting temperature in Celsius (°C)
- **finalTemperature**: Target temperature in Celsius (°C)
- **Q**: Energy result in Joules (J)
- **4184**: Specific heat capacity of water (J/kg·°C)

## How to Run
The program runs via the configured workflow which compiles and executes the Java file.

## Features
- Prompts user for water mass, initial temperature, and final temperature
- Calculates energy using the water heating formula
- Displays formatted results with units
- Handles invalid input with error messages
- Indicates when cooling occurs (negative energy) or no change needed

## Project Structure
- `WaterHeatingCalculator.java` - Main program file

## Recent Changes
- **December 08, 2025**: Initial creation of water heating energy calculator
